Dictionaries are made from extracted wiktionary content. Their quality depends on wiktionary [coverage](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary/Table) and [wiktextract](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract) quality of extracted fields.

## Dictionary types

These are the different types of dictionaries that can be made with wty (optional parameters have been omitted):

```console
$ wty main              <SOURCE> <TARGET>
$ wty ipa               <SOURCE> <TARGET>
$ wty ipa-merged        <TARGET>
$ wty glossary          <SOURCE> <TARGET>
$ wty glossary-extended <EDITION> <SOURCE> <TARGET>
```

- **main**: main dictionaries, with etymology, examples etc. These have good coverage, but tend to be verbose.
- **glossary**: short dictionaries made from Wiktionary translations section.
- **ipa**: pronunciation dictionaries.

!!! tip "Reminder: roughly, the source is the language we learn. The target is the language we know."

| Dictionary type | Edition(s)  | Source  | Target  |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| **main**        | **TARGET** | source  | **TARGET** |
| **ipa**         | **TARGET** | source  | **TARGET** |
| **ipa-merged**  | ALL    | X    | target |
| **glossary**    | **SOURCE** | **SOURCE** | target |
| **glossary-extended**    | edition | source | target |

!!! tip "Identical cells in a row are highlighted in bold UPPERCASE"

## Paths

When building locally, dictionaries are usually stored in: `ROOT/dict/SOURCE/TARGET/wty-SOURCE-TARGET.zip`.

The only exception being ipa-merged, since it has no source.

```console
$ wty main de en
✓ Wrote yomitan dict @ data/dict/de/en/wty-de-en.zip (16.05 MB)
$ wty glossary de en
✓ Wrote yomitan dict @ data/dict/de/en/wty-de-en-gloss.zip (3.58 MB)
$ wty ipa-merged en
✓ Wrote yomitan dict @ data/dict/en/all/wty-en-ipa.zip (4.45 MB)
$ wty glossary-extended all de en
✓ Wrote yomitan dict @ data/dict/de/en/wty-all-de-en-gloss.zip (2.70 MB)
```

## Notes

As of now, there is no way to make a **main** dictionary with only lemmas, or only forms. See this [issue](https://github.com/yomidevs/wiktionary-to-yomitan/issues/166).

It is possible to hack your way around it, either by modifying the code as stated in the issue above, or by manually deleting the unwanted banks,
since the writter will jump to a next bank when we go from lemmas to forms.
